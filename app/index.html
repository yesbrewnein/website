            Hi, my name is Max and I'm a homebrewer from Potsdam, Germany. With this site I'm trying to keep
            track of my homebrewing efforts. I started brewing in late 2014, trying to make beer that is
            drinkable but also different from the usual German macro beers. Below you
            find a list of all the brews that I made so far; each with a description of the ingredients
            I used and some tasting notes.<br>
            To better characterize my beers, I try to give them a meaningful name and design a label which reflects the color,
            style, and/or ingredients of the beer.
            Since there are so many styles to brew, I usually try not to make the same beer twice but maybe I
            re-brew a beer if it tasted especially good. I'm storing my recipes at <a class="bold" target="_blank" href="http://brewgr.com/!/yesBREWnein">brewgr</a>
            which is a nice way of keeping track and making them open source.
            If you like to contact me, send a mail to <a class="bold" href="mailto:yesbrewnein@gmail.com">yesbrewnein</a>.

                  <p class="beer_list_item_description">
                    My first brew in 2016 was an Extra Strong Bitter with a traditional English ale yeast (WLP002).
                    I wanted to have a nice malty ale, so I chose Maris Otter as the base malt for lots of biscuity flavor
                    supported by some medium crystal, a bit of very dark crystal, and a tiny bit of black malt.
                    For hopping I used only East Kent Goldings to get a typical English bittering character. To get as
                    much hop flavor as possible without being too bitter, I used a combination of first wort hopping and
                    whirlpooling with a target of 40 IBU.</br>
                    The fermentation was quite vigorous for the first couple of days and brought the OG of 1.059 to an FG
                    of 1.012 after two weeks in the primary, which ended up in 6% ABV and was exactly what I wanted.
                    However, bottling with the ESB yeast can be a nightmare. In some cases, the yeast woke up during bottling
                    and started fermenting again which led to some overcarbonated bottles. This is probably due to the super
                    high flocculation characteristics of this yeast. For the next beer with the ESB yeast, I have to rouse it
                    regularly and maybe even use a second, less flocculating yeast in the secondary fermentation to clean up
                    properly before bottling.</br>
                    The beer has a great malty and also quite fruity flavor with some earthiness and a little bit of honey from
                    the hops. The bitterness is very smooth and feels more like 30 than 40 IBU. The first wort hopping really
                    worked for me in this beer.

                  <p class="beer_list_item_description">
                    Although the name maybe suggests an Old Ale, brew #6 is an American barleywine hopped only
                    with Simcoe hops. I wanted to see if I can manage to brew a barleywine with my system and
                    my brewing techniques. Since I read that the mash efficiency is relatively low for big beers,
                    I used 9.5 kilograms of malt for 15 liters with a target of roughly 10% ABV and 100 IBU. The malt bill
                    consisted of 94% pale ale malt, 3% CaraAmber, and 3% CaraMunich II.
                    For fermentation I used most of the WLP001 yeast cake from brew #5. The beer went from 1.105
                    to 1.020 which leads to roughly 11% ABV. Hence, mission accomplished.<br>
                    After the primary fermentation was over, the beer went into secondary for one month of conditioning.
                    I had a first try after additional 3 months of bottle conditioning. At first it was pretty
                    overwhelming because 11% ABV in a beer is a lot. Due to the high attenuation the
                    beer is not really sweet and that is good. So far, it has a very nice malty taste with the hops struggling
                    a bit to hold up against the alcohol. I will let it mellow out for another 3 or 6 months
                    and try it again.

                  <p class="beer_list_item_description">
                    Pumpkin meets beet root for the ultimate autumn ale vegetable clash, featuring pumpkin pie spices like
                    cinnamon, nutmeg, clove, ginger, and cardamom. To support the earthy flavor of beet root,
                    I used German Magnum and Northern Brewer hops for bittering and flavor with a target of 45 IBU. For aroma, I used freshly picked
                    wild hops from the Uckermark (the place where I grew up) as a whirlpool addition. The malt base consists of pale ale and vienna
                    malt, and some light and medium crystal malt for body and color. I also added a bit of Carafa Special II malt
                    to get a deep reddish color, but instead it got brown. However, when I poured the fermented beer on to the
                    beet root in the secondary, it got bloody dark red. The beer finished at around 5% ABV.<br>
                    The first thing to notice about the beer is a really nice pink head.
                    The scent of the beer contains lots of cinnamon, ginger, and clove mixed
                    with earthiness of beet root. The beginning is slightly sweet which turns into
                    a spice dominated finish. Hop bitterness is present but has only a supportive role.<br>
                    I wouldn't call this a drinkable everyday beer, but as an autumn/ winter seasonal it works for me.
                    I should probably do a split badge w/o beet root if I brew it again, and leave the Carafa malt out.

                  <p class="beer_list_item_description">
                    A Cascadian Dark Ale made with rye for a slight spicyness and Hull Melon for a
                    melon-like hop aroma. That was the premise for brew #4. For the malt base I used
                    85% pale ale malt and 8% rye malt accompanied by 3% of CaraMunich II and 4% dehusked
                    Carafa II malt for a rich body and a nice dark color without being overly roasty. I hopped
                    with German Magnum, Cascade, and Hull Melon for a citrussy and honeydew melon aroma
                    with a target of 65 IBU. For fermentation I used WLP001.<br>
                    I aimed for an OG of 1.070 but unfortunately the malt was not properly crushed, so
                    I ended up with 1.050 OG. The final beer had 1.012 which leads to around Alc. 4.9% Vol. Hence,
                    it was more a session version of a Cascadian Dark Ale. The beer has a nice dark, almost
                    opaque color with ruby accents. The body is quite balanced with a nice mouthfeel and
                    a fruity aroma with hints of roastiness. Unfortunately there is no melon aroma at all.
                    It's more a mixture of citrus and strawberry which the Hull Melon is also known for. The
                    finish is heavily hoppy but not overwhelming.

                    Brew #1 was all extract. Brew #2 was extract with grains. So, brew #3 had to be all-grain
                    to follow the scheme. After brewing two ales, I also wanted to make a lager. California
                    Common was the obvious choice as I can ferment it at nearly room temperature. Following this
                    simple beer style, I used 90% pale ale malt and 10% medium caramel malt. The hopping was done
                    using only German Northern Brewer with a target of 35 IBU. For fermentation I made a starter from
                    a pack of Wyeast 2112.<br>
                    Brew #3 turned out to be a reddish copper colored, malty, and moderately hopped lager with
                    a slightly fruity aroma. Building up carbonation took a lot of time, but after around two
                    months, the mouthfeel was great.

                    As an IPA seemed too intimidating for my second try, I went for an American Pale Ale with
                    a triple hop combination of Columbus, Amarillo&reg;, and Ahtanum&trade; with a target of 60 IBU.
                    For the malt base I used extra light dry malt extract and light liquid malt extract. To enhance the
                    taste and to advance my brewing process, I used Maris Otter pale ale as a steeping addition.
                    For fermentation I used Mangrove Jack's London Ale dry yeast.<br>
                    The beer turned out deep golden with a citrussy and floral aroma. The malt character was more
                    subtle than for brew #1, creating a slighter body. The carbonation was a bit
                    strong without being a Hefeweizen or Belgian Wit. The finish was hoppy and bitter but not as
                    long lasting as for brew #1.

                    This was my first ever homebrew. Planned as a hoppy american amber ale, it turned out
                    more ruby than amber. It was brewed with light and amber liquid malt extract and
                    four different hops: Polaris, Nugget, Willamette, and Saphir; targeting 70 IBU which was a
                    bit too much. I additionally dry-hopped it with Polaris and Willamette.
                    Starting out with dry yeast, I used Nottingham ale yeast for a fruity fermentation.<br>
                    The taste turned out to be quite malty with a fruity hop character at the beginning and
                    a long lasting bitter finish. There was no minty hop character from Polaris at all, but
                    this could have been caused by using too many hop varieties.

          <h3 class="bold"> Why I began homebrewing </h3>
          <p>
            When I visited New York in 2014, I learned that beer can be more than Pilsener,
            Dortmunder Export, and Hefeweizen. After I tried american pale ales and vienna lagers, I was
            instantly hooked by the rich taste in comparison to boring, bland tasting German macro beer.
            Back in Germany, I did a bit of investigation and discovered a whole world of beer styles like brown ales,
            porters, IPAs, imperial stouts, or barleywines. And the best thing is that you can actually
            make these at home, and there are tons of information available about homebrewing.<br>
            Although there are German books about brewing, I started reading <a class="bold" target="_blank" href="http://howtobrew.com/intro.html">How to Brew</a>
            because Germans tend to overcomplicate things especially when explaining something technical like brewing that has
            such a long tradition in Germany. Since I don't like prebuilt things
            that I can't modify, I didn't go for the usual pre-hopped beer kit. Instead, I bought some malt
            extracts and hops and tried to make a beer which is a bit more of my own.<br>
            After I made my first two badges based on malt extract, I wanted to do something more interesting
            and so I went for all-grain. Since a Braumeister was too expensive, I build a mash-lauter-tun from
            a camping cooler with a copper manifold. For making a yeast starter, I build a stir-plate
            from a wooden box, a PC-case fan, and a magnet from an old hard drive. There is a lot to learn
            from American homebrewers when it comes to equipment. At first, my brewing efficiency was about
            60%. After adjusting the mash ph and using batch sparging with equal runnings, it is now at 70%.
