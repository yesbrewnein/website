            Hi, my name is Max and I'm a homebrewer from Potsdam, Germany. With this site I'm trying to keep
            track of my homebrewing efforts. I started brewing in late 2014, trying to make beer that is
            drinkable but also different from the usual German macro beers. Below you
            find a list of all the brews that I made so far; each with a description of the ingredients
            I used and some tasting notes.<br>
            To better characterize my beers, I try to give them a meaningful name and design a label which reflects the color,
            style, and/or ingredients of the beer.
            Since there are so many styles to brew, I usually try not to make the same beer twice but maybe I 
            re-brew a beer if it needed a bit of refinement. I'm planning to store my recipes at <a class="bold" target="_blank" href="http://brewgr.com/!/yesBREWnein">brewgr</a>
            which is a nice way of keeping track and making them open source.
            If you like to contact me, send a mail to <a class="bold" href="mailto:yesbrewnein@gmail.com">yesbrewnein</a>.

                    This was my first ever homebrew. Planned as a hoppy american amber ale, it turned out
                    more ruby than amber. It was brewed with light and amber liquid malt extract and
                    four different hops: Polaris, Nugget, Willamette, and Saphir; targeting 70 IBU which was a
                    bit too much. I additionally dry-hopped it with Polaris and Willamette.
                    Starting out with dry yeast, I used Nottingham ale yeast for a fruity fermentation.<br>
                    The taste turned out to be quite malty with a fruity hop character at the beginning and
                    a long lasting bitter finish. There was no minty hop character from Polaris at all, but
                    this could have been caused by using too many hop varieties.

                    As an IPA seemed too intimidating for my second try, I went for an American Pale Ale with
                    a triple hop combination of Columbus, Amarillo&reg;, and Ahtanum&trade; with a target of 60 IBU.
                    For the malt base I used extra light dry malt extract and light liquid malt extract. To enhance the
                    taste and to advance my brewing process, I used Maris Otter pale ale as a steeping addition.
                    For fermentation I used Mangrove Jack's London Ale dry yeast.<br>
                    The beer turned out deep golden with a citrussy and floral aroma. The malt character was more
                    subtle than for brew #1, creating a slighter body. The carbonation was a bit
                    strong without being a Hefeweizen or Belgian Wit. The finish was hoppy and bitter but not as
                    long lasting as for brew #1.

                    Brew #1 was all extract. Brew #2 was extract with grains. So, brew #3 had to be all-grain
                    to follow the scheme. After brewing two ales, I also wanted to make a lager. California
                    Common was the obvious choice as I can ferment it at nearly room temperature. Following this
                    simple beer style, I used 90% pale ale malt and 10% medium caramel malt. The hopping was done
                    using only German Northern Brewer with a target of 35 IBU. For fermentation I made a starter from
                    a pack of Wyeast 2112.<br>
                    Brew #3 turned out to be a reddish copper colored, malty, and moderately hopped lager with
                    a slightly fruity aroma. Building up carbonation took a lot of time, but after around two
                    months, the mouthfeel was great.

                    A Cascadian Dark Ale made with rye for a slight spicyness and Hull Melon for a
                    melon-like hop aroma. That was the premise for brew #4. For the malt base I used 
                    85% pale ale malt and 8% rye malt accompanied by 3% of CaraMunich II and 4% dehusked
                    Carafa II malt for a rich body and a nice dark color without being overly roasty. I hopped
                    with German Magnum, Cascade, and Hull Melon for a citrussy and honeydew melon aroma
                    with a target of 65 IBU. For fermentation I used WLP001.<br>
                    I aimed for an OG of 1.070 but unfortunately the malt was not properly crushed, so
                    I ended up with 1.050 OG. The final beer had 1.012 which leads to around Alc. 4.9% Vol. Hence,
                    it was more a session version of a Cascadian Dark Ale. The beer has a nice dark, almost
                    opaque color with ruby accents. The body is quite balanced with a nice mouthfeel and
                    a fruity aroma with hints of roastiness. Unfortunately there is no melon aroma at all.
                    It's more a mixture of citrus and strawberry which the Hull Melon is also known for. The
                    finish is heavily hoppy but not overwhelming.

          <h3 class="bold"> Why I began homebrewing </h3>
          <p>
            When I visited New York in 2014, I learned that beer can be more than Pilsener,
            Dortmunder Export, and Hefeweizen. After I tried american pale ales and vienna lagers, I was
            instantly hooked by the rich taste in comparison to boring, bland tasting German macro beer.
            Back in Germany, I did a bit of investigation and discovered a whole world of beer styles like brown ales,
            porters, IPAs, imperial stouts, or barleywines. And the best thing is that you can actually
            make these at home, and there are tons of information available about homebrewing.<br>
            Although there are German books about brewing, I started reading <a class="bold" target="_blank" href="http://howtobrew.com/intro.html">How to Brew</a>
            because Germans tend to overcomplicate things especially when explaining something technical like brewing that has
            such a long tradition in Germany. Since I don't like prebuilt things
            that I can't modify, I didn't go for the usual pre-hopped beer kit. Instead, I bought some malt
            extracts and hops and tried to make a beer which is a bit more of my own.<br>
            After I made my first two badges based on malt extract, I wanted to do something more interesting
            and so I went for all-grain. Since a Braumeister was too expensive, I build a mash-lauter-tun from
            a camping cooler with a copper manifold. For making a yeast starter, I build a stir-plate
            from a wooden box, a PC-case fan, and a magnet from an old hard drive. There is a lot to learn
            from American homebrewers when it comes to equipment. My brewing efficiency so far is about
            60% which still leaves some room for improvement.
